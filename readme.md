# Interview Question

## Q1. What is Programming Language?

Ans: A programming language is a set of instructions and rules used to create software, applications, or websites. It allows programmers to write code that computers can understand and execute to perform various tasks. Programming languages come in different types, each with its own syntax and capabilities, and they are used to develop a wide range of software and systems. Examples of programming languages include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and many others.

## Q2. What is Funcational Programming?

Ans: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. It focuses on the use of pure functions, which produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. Functional programming encourages immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative programming styles.

## Q3. Low level Programming Language?

Ans: Low-level programming languages are languages that are closer to the hardware and provide little abstraction 
from the machine's architecture. They directly represent the instructions understood by the computer's processor, making them more difficult to read and write compared to high-level languages. Examples include assembly language and machine code. These languages offer precise control over hardware resources but require more effort and expertise to use effectively.

## Q4. High level Programming Language?

Ans: A high-level programming language is a programming language that abstracts away many of the complexities of the computer's hardware architecture, making it easier for programmers to write code. High-level languages are designed to be closer to human language and concepts, allowing developers to focus more on the problem-solving aspect of programming rather than the intricacies of machine operations. Examples of high-level programming languages include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

## Q5. What do you mean by platform independent?

Ans: "Platform independent" means that something, like a software program or a technology, can work on different types of devices or operating systems without needing to be modified for each specific one. It's like a universal language that can be understood and used everywhere, regardless of the underlying system.

## What is header file, type of header file in c.

Ans: In C programming, a header file is a file containing declarations and definitions of functions, variables, constants, and other data types that are used in a program. Header files typically have a .h extension and are included at the beginning of a C source file using the #include preprocessor directive.

There are several types of header files in C:

Standard Library Header Files: These header files contain declarations and definitions for functions and constants provided by the standard C library. Examples include <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <math.h>, and <string.h>.

User-defined Header Files: These header files are created by the programmer to organize and encapsulate code into reusable modules. They typically contain function prototypes, type definitions, and other declarations relevant to the module.

External Library Header Files: If your program uses external libraries, you may need to include their header files to access the functions and data types provided by those libraries.

System Header Files: These header files are provided by the operating system and contain declarations for system functions and data types. Examples include <unistd.h> for Unix-like systems and <windows.h> for Windows systems.


## Q Compiler name of c

Ans: 
The compiler commonly used for C programming is called "gcc" (GNU Compiler Collection). It is a free and open-source compiler developed by the GNU Project and supports various programming languages, including C, C++, and Fortran. Additionally, there are other compilers available for C programming, such as Clang, Microsoft Visual C++, and Intel C Compiler.
